Unlike a classical computer, a quantum computer operates on quantum principles. Ideally, they are good at solving certain problems that even a supercomputer cannot handle. But, present-day quantum computers are in the early stages of development, analogous to the vacuum chamber tube era of classical computers. My research is mainly on developing and employing algorithms suited for these Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum machines(NISQ). I hope all these efforts pave the way to better computing and applications with the advent of better quantum machines in the future! 

I have used quantum computers for adiabatic state preparation, computing correlation functions, finding partition function zeros, and implementing subspace diagonalization. I have worked on using entanglement witnesses for benchmarking quantum computers. In addition, I also have some experience with machine learning.
