My research so far is in Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum machines(NISQ) algorithms and applications. So far I have used quantum computers for adiabatic state preparation, computing correlation functions, finding partition function zeros, implementing subspace diagonalization. I have worked on using entanglement witnesses for benchmarking quantum computers. In addition, I also have some experience with machine learning.
