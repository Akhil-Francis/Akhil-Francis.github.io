Welcome!!!

I am a graduate student at North Carolina State University pursuing Ph.D. with [Dr. Alexander F. Kemper](https://www.physics.ncsu.edu/kemperlab/ ) at [North Carolina
State University](https://physics.ncsu.edu). My core expertise is in using quantum algorithms for tackling condensed matter problems. I have completed a BS-MS degree in physics at [IISER, Mohali India](https://www.iisermohali.ac.in/). Here you will find a flavor of my research.
