Welcome!!!

I am a graduate student at [North Carolina State University](https://physics.ncsu.edu), [pursuing Ph.D.](https://kemperlab.github.io/team/akhil-francis/) in Physics. I am generally interested in topics related to physics, mathematics, and computer science and particularly in quantum computing. My expertise is in using quantum algorithms for solving condensed matter physics problems. Present-day quantum computers are in the early stages of development, analogous to the vacuum chamber tube era of 'classical' computers. Implementing algorithms suited for these machines is needed to move the technology forward. My research is mainly on employing these real quantum machines to get something useful. I hope all these efforts pave the way to better computing and applications with the advent of better quantum machines in the future!  
Previously, I completed my BS-MS degree in physics at [IISER, Mohali India](https://www.iisermohali.ac.in/). In this website mostly you will find a flavor of my research.
