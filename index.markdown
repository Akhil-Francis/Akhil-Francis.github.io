 I am a researcher in quantum computing. My expertise is in using quantum algorithms for solving condensed matter physics problems. I have experience in benchmarking quantum machines. Recently, I am interested in using machine learning tools, especially to aid in quantum computing.


### Education
I am [pursuing Ph.D.](https://kemperlab.github.io/team/akhil-francis/) in physics at [North Carolina State University](https://physics.ncsu.edu).

Previously, I completed my BS-MS degree in physics at [IISER, Mohali India](https://www.iisermohali.ac.in/).
